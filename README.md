# Cantamus
Singing synth system for the rest of us (frontend)
# What is this about?
Cantamus is a singing synthesis system for Linux and possibly macOS. Originally intended to be a system of its own, Cantamus aims to provide an UTAU-compatible experience
#Requirements
- libcantamus
- stksamp

#Caveats
As of current, voicebanks need to be set up with a bank.conf file. A bank.conf file is the equaliment of the character.txt of UTAU voicebanks. A text file with name=foo is sufficient to be a valid bank.conf.
#License
Cantamus is licensed under the MIT license
